# Golf Tournament API (QAP 4)

This is my project for the QAP in Software Design, Architecture, and Testing.

It's a Spring Boot REST API that manages golf club members and tournaments. You can add members, create tournaments, assign members to tournaments, and search based on name, phone, email, and more.
